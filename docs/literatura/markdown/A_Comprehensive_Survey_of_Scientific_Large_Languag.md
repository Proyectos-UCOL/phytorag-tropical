## Abstract



In many scientific fields, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way text
and other modalities of data (e.g., molecules
and proteins) are handled, achieving superior performance in various applications and
augmenting the scientific discovery process.
Nevertheless, previous surveys on scientific
LLMs often concentrate on one or two fields
or a single modality. In this paper, we aim
to provide a more holistic view of the research landscape by unveiling cross-field and
cross-modal connections between scientific
LLMs regarding their architectures and pretraining techniques. To this end, we comprehensively survey over 260 scientific LLMs,
discuss their commonalities and differences,
as well as summarize pre-training datasets
and evaluation tasks for each field and modality.
Moreover, we investigate how LLMs
have been deployed to benefit scientific discovery. Resources related to this survey are available at https://github.com/yuzhimanhua/
Awesome-Scientific-Language-Models.

Introduction

The emergence of large language models (LLMs)
(Zhao et al., 2023c) brings a new paradigm to natural language processing (NLP) by replacing specialized models designed for each task with unified
models that are reasonably effective for a wide
spectrum of problems. In the scientific domain,
such a paradigm not only reshapes people’s strategies to handle tasks related to natural language (e.g.,
scientific papers, medical records, and climate reports) but also inspires analogous ideas to deal with
other types of data (e.g., molecules, proteins, tables,
and metadata). In addition to understanding existing scientific data, LLMs have shown their potential to accelerate scientific discovery (Wang et al.,
2023c; Zhang et al., 2023e; Wang et al., 2024d)
through generation, planning, etc.

∗Equal contribution

Given the broad and profound impact of LLMs
in various scientific fields across diverse modalities,
it becomes necessary to comprehensively review
related work in this direction. However, existing
scientific LLM surveys typically focus on either
one or two fields (e.g., biomedicine (Wang et al.,
2023a; He et al., 2024b; Pei et al., 2024; Zhang
et al., 2024d) and chemistry (Xia et al., 2023; Pei
et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024d)) or one modality
(e.g., text (Ho et al., 2024)) only. In fact, if we take
a holistic view of the research landscape, we can
observe similar and interrelated techniques used to
develop LLMs for different fields and modalities.

Figure 1 depicts three major types of scientific LLM pre-training strategies (i.e., COLUMNS
1 to 3), for each of which we give 4 examples
(i.e., TYPES A to D).
In COLUMN 1, following BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa
(Liu et al., 2019), existing studies use masked language modeling (MLM) to pre-train encoder language models. Here, the input can be naturally
sequential (e.g., papers in each field; protein, DNA,
and RNA sequences in the FASTA format (Lipman and Pearson, 1985)) or artificially linearized
(e.g., molecules in the SMILES format (Weininger,
1988); sequences of venue, author, and reference
nodes in citation graphs). In COLUMN 2, inspired
by GPT (Brown et al., 2020) and LLaMA (Touvron
et al., 2023a), previous studies adopt next token
prediction to pre-train (encoder-)decoder language
models, some of which further adopt instruction
tuning and preference optimization (Ouyang et al.,
2022). Other than plain text input (e.g., questionanswer pairs from knowledge bases or exams), we
see more ways to sequentialize complex scientific
data, such as flattening table cells and using particle coordinates to describe crystals. Even for
images, there are studies in both mathematics (Gao
et al., 2023) and biomedicine (Li et al., 2023a)
that exploit a vision encoder to project an image
onto several visual tokens and prepend them to text
tokens as linearized LLM input. In COLUMN 3,

Figure 1: Three major types of scientific LLM pre-training techniques. (COLUMN 1): Pre-training encoder
LLMs with sequentialized scientific data (e.g., text, academic graphs, molecules, biological sequences) via masked
language modeling. (COLUMN 2): Pre-training (encoder-)decoder LLMs with sequentialized scientific data (e.g.,
text, tables, crystals, images) via next token prediction (possibly with instruction tuning). (COLUMN 3): Mapping
text and relevant sequences/graphs/images closer in the latent space via contrastive learning.

following DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and CLIP
(Radford et al., 2021), two encoders are pre-trained
to map relevant data pairs closer in the latent space
via contrastive learning. When both modalities
are sequential (e.g., text-text or text-protein), the
model is built upon two LLM encoders. When
we prefer to keep the non-sequential nature of one
modality (e.g., molecular graphs (Edwards et al.,
2021), chest X-rays (Zhang et al., 2022), and aerial
views (Yan et al., 2024)), the corresponding graph
or image encoder can be employed. To summarize, a cross-field, cross-modal survey will more
accurately draw the connections between different
scientific LLMs, demonstrate their commonalities,
and potentially guide their future designs.

Contributions. In this paper, motivated by the
discussions above, we systematically survey over
260 scientific LLMs encompassing various fields

(e.g., general science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, medicine, and geoscience), modalities (e.g., language, graph, vision,
table, molecule, protein, genome, and climate time
series), and sizes (from ∼100M to ∼100B parameters). For each field/modality, we investigate commonly adopted pre-training datasets, model architectures, and evaluation tasks of scientific LLMs.
Following our motivation, when we discuss model
architectures in detail, we link them back to Figure 1 to build cross-field cross-modal connections.
Moreover, we provide a structured summary of
these scientific LLMs in Table A1-Table A6 (Appendix A). Furthermore, for different fields, we
introduce how LLMs have been deployed to benefit
science by augmenting different aspects and stages
of the scientific discovery process, such as hypothesis generation, theorem proving, experiment design,
drug discovery, and weather forecasting.

LLMs in General Science (Table A1)

2.1
Language

The most commonly used pre-training corpora for
scientific LLMs are research papers from bibliographic databases, such as AMiner (Tang et al.,
2008), Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) (Sinha
et al., 2015), and Semantic Scholar (Ammar et al.,
2018). Some of these sources (e.g., S2ORC (Lo
et al., 2020)) contain full-text information of papers, while the others have titles and abstracts only.

The evolution of scientific LLMs bears similarity to that of general-domain LLMs. Specifically, pioneering models utilize paper text in a
self-supervised manner during pre-training, aiming
to acquire scientific knowledge from large-scale
unlabeled corpora. For example, masked language
modeling (MLM) is the default pre-training task
for scientific LLMs with a BERT backbone (TYPE
1.A in Figure 1, e.g., SciBERT (Beltagy et al.,
2019)); next token prediction is widely used for
GPT-based scientific LLMs (TYPE 2.A in Figure 1,
e.g., SciGPT (Luu et al., 2021)). More recently,
inspired by the fact that LLMs can be trained to
follow natural language instructions (Wei et al.,
2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022), researchers have put
more effort into tuning LLMs with instructions to
solve complex scientific problems (TYPE 2.A, e.g.,
Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022) and SciGLM (Zhang
et al., 2024a)). The instruction tuning data are often
derived from datasets for downstream tasks, such
as exam question answering (Welbl et al., 2017),
and further filtered or augmented by humans or
existing LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023)).

General scientific LLMs are usually evaluated
on common NLP tasks, such as named entity
recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE) (Luan
et al., 2018), question answering (QA) (Wang et al.,
2024f), and classification (Cohan et al., 2019).

2.2
Language + Graph

Beyond plain text, scientific papers are associated
with rich metadata including venues, authors, and
references (Zhang et al., 2023g). Such metadata
connect papers into a graph that complements text
signals for characterizing paper semantics. To exploit metadata, some studies (TYPE 1.B, e.g., OAGBERT (Liu et al., 2022b)) concatenate paper text
with venues/authors as input and perform MLM
on both text and metadata; others (TYPE 3.A, e.g.,
SPECTER (Cohan et al., 2020)) take citation links
as supervision and train LLMs to encode linked
papers closer in the embedding space. Recent approaches further modify the Transformer architec-

ture in LLMs with Adapters (Singh et al., 2023),
GNN-nested Transformers (Jin et al., 2023b), and
Mixture-of-Experts Transformers (Zhang et al.,
2023f) to better capture graph signals.
Graph-aware scientific LLMs are often evaluated on tasks regarding the relation between two
text units (e.g., paper-paper or query-paper), including link prediction, retrieval, recommendation,
and author name disambiguation. SciDocs (Cohan
et al., 2020) and SciRepEval (Singh et al., 2023)
are widely adopted benchmark datasets.

2.3
Applications in Scientific Discovery

Performant scientific LLMs can work alongside
researchers throughout the entire scientific discovery process. Leaving field-specific applications for
later sections, here we underscore LLMs’ general
usefulness in brainstorming and evaluation: Lahav
et al. (2022) integrate LLMs into a search engine
for the discovery of scientific challenges and directions; Wang et al. (2023e), Yang et al. (2024d),
Baek et al. (2024), Gu and Krenn (2024), and Si
et al. (2024) leverage LLMs to generate novel scientific ideas, directions, and hypotheses on the basis
of prior literature and existing knowledge; Zhang
et al. (2023h) rely on LLMs to find expert reviewers
for each submission; Liu and Shah (2023), Liang
et al. (2024c), and D’Arcy et al. (2024) explore
the capacity of GPT-4 to provide useful feedback
on research papers to facilitate automatic review
generation; Liang et al. (2024b,a) also observe the
increasing use of LLMs in writing scientific papers
and conference peer reviews.

LLMs in Mathematics (Table A2)

3.1
Language

The pre-training text corpora for mathematics
LLMs can be categorized into two classes: (1)
multiple-choice QA, the representative datasets
of which include MathQA (Amini et al., 2019),
Ape210K (Zhao et al., 2020), and Math23K (Wang
et al., 2017); as well as (2) generative QA, the representative datasets of which include GSM8K (Cobbe
et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), and
MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024c).

Similarly to general science LLMs, the backbone
model of pioneering mathematics LLMs is BERT
(TYPE 1.A, e.g., GenBERT (Geva et al., 2020) and
MathBERT (Shen et al., 2021)), and these models are mostly trained via MLM. For GPT-based
mathematics LLMs (TYPE 2.A, e.g., GSM8K-GPT
(Cobbe et al., 2021) and NaturalProver (Welleck
et al., 2022)), next token prediction and instruc-

---

tion tuning are major pre-training tasks to generate
mathematical proofs and reasoning processes. The
most recent models (TYPE 2.A, e.g., Rho-Math
(Lin et al., 2024b) and MAmmoTH2 (Yue et al.,
2024c)) are based on LLaMA and are trained to follow natural language instructions. However, when
an enormous pre-training corpus is available (e.g.,
mathematical web pages and code), next token
prediction is still favored as the mere pre-training
task (Azerbayev et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024b) or
the companion task (Shao et al., 2024; Ying et al.,
2024) to build base models.
QA and math world problems (MWP) have been
the most common evaluation tasks for mathematics
LLMs. In addition, quantitative reasoning contains
more difficult problems, as the model has to provide a complete and self-contained solution without relying on external tools (Shao et al., 2024; Lin
et al., 2024b). We see a dominance of use from
GSM8K and MATH for QA, and from MathQA
and Math23K for MWP. For quantitative reasoning, MMLU-STEM (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and
Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2023) are the most
widely adopted.

3.2
Language + Vision

Geometry is one of the most important branches of
mathematics, and it expresses the settings jointly
in text and diagrams. As such, it is mandatory to
involve the vision modality for geometry LLMs.
The most commonly used pre-training datasets for
geometry LLMs include Geometry3K (Lu et al.,
2021) and GeoQA (Chen et al., 2021), both of
which contain multiple-choice geometry problems.

The key to incorporating the vision modality
into LLMs is to encode the images and obtain linearized visual representations. Specifically, InterGPS (Lu et al., 2021) (TYPE 2.D) uses RetinaNet
(Lin et al., 2017) to transform images into a set of
relationships and then applies BART (Lewis et al.,
2020a) to produce the solution; G-LLaVA (Gao
et al., 2023) (TYPE 2.D) encodes visual input via a
pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT), concatenates
visual embeddings with textual embeddings, and
then feeds the concatenation into LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). These models are by default
pre-trained via sequence-to-sequence tasks, where
the problem is the input, and the ground-truth answer with optional rationale is the output. Auxiliary loss such as masked image modeling, image
construction, or text-image matching, is optionally
added for better visual modeling.

Geometry LLMs are evaluated through geometry
problem solving, where the model is asked to select

the correct answer given the diagram and its caption, the question, and answer options. Renowned
evaluation datasets include Geometry3K (Lu et al.,
2021), GEOS (Seo et al., 2015), and MathVista (Lu
et al., 2024).

3.3
Table

A large proportion of math knowledge is stored in
the form of tabular data. For the “Table” modality, notable resources for pre-training include WikiTableQuestions (Pasupat and Liang, 2015), WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017), and WDC Web Table
(Lehmberg et al., 2016).

The challenge in tables is similar to that in diagrams, namely to obtain linearized table representations. In most cases, tables are squeezed into
linear text sequences as part of the context and are
prepended with the question text as the model input.
As one of the first works in this line of research,
TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) (TYPE 1.A) adopts the
MLM objective to predict the masked token in both
textual and tabular contexts. Recent developments
(Li et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024f) resemble the
design of TableLlama (Zhang et al., 2024e) (TYPE
2.B), with LLaMA-2 as the backbone and instruction tuning as the pre-training task.

Table LLMs are validated through table QA,
where the model is asked to produce the correct
answer given the table structure, data values, and a
question text. Most existing studies have been evaluated on the WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL
datasets. TableInstruct (Zhang et al., 2024e) is
the most recently developed comprehensive benchmark integrating 14 datasets across 11 tasks.

3.4
Applications in Scientific Discovery

Mathematics LLMs have great potential to assist
humans in offering potential solutions.
For instance, AlphaGeometry (Trinh et al., 2024) combines an LLM with a symbolic deduction engine,
where the LLM generates useful constructs and
the symbolic engine applies formal logic to find
solutions. AlphaGeometry solves 25 out of 30 classical geometry problems adapted from the International Mathematical Olympiad. Sinha et al. (2024)
extend AlphaGeometry by adding Wu’s method
(Chou, 1988), further solving 27 out of 30, surpassing human gold medalists. FunSearch (RomeraParedes et al., 2024) integrates LLM with program
search. One notable achievement of FunSearch
is its ability to find a new solution to the cap set
problem in combinatorial optimization. The solutions generated can be faster and more efficient
than those devised by human experts. In Li et al.

---

(2024a), LLMs iteratively propose and critique statistical models by leveraging in-context learning
and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b).

LLMs in Physics (Table A3)

4.1
Language

As a derivative of BERT, astroBERT (Grezes et al.,
2024) (TYPE 1.A) is further pre-trained using
astronomy-related papers via MLM and next sentence prediction.
It is evaluated on the NER
task.
Likewise, AstroLLaMA (Nguyen et al.,
2023b) (TYPE 2.A) fine-tunes LLaMA-2 using
over 300,000 astronomy abstracts from arXiv. It
is evaluated on paper generation and recommendation tasks. AstroLLaMA-chat (Perkowski et al.,
2024) (TYPE 2.A) is the chat version of AstroLLaMA. It is continually trained on a GPT-4 generated domain-specific dialogue dataset. PhysBERT
(Hellert et al., 2024) (TYPE 1.A) is the first physicsspecific model for sentence embedding trained on
a curated corpus of physics literature based on 1.2
million physics papers on arXiv. It is evaluated on
physics-tailored tasks, such as information retrieval,
classification, and semantic similarity estimation.

4.2
Applications in Scientific Discovery

Transformer-based physics LLMs can potentially
assist humans in solving differential equations and
designing experiments. For instance, Cai et al.
(2024) apply Transformer to predict the integer
coefficients in the scattering amplitudes of Planar
N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory; RydbergGPT
(Fitzek et al., 2024) uses Transformer to learn the
distribution of qubit measurement outcomes that
describe an array of interacting Rydberg atoms;
Arlt et al. (2024) present an initial trial that applies
a code-generating LLM to synthesize experimental
blueprints for a whole class of quantum systems in
the form of Python code.

LLMs in Chemistry and Materials
Science (Table A4)

5.1
Language

LLM pre-training corpora in chemistry and materials science typically come from research papers and databases (e.g., Materials Project (Jain
et al., 2013)). Besides, recent works adopt domainspecific instruction tuning datasets (e.g., MolInstructions (Fang et al., 2024a) and SMolInstruct
(Yu et al., 2024a)) derived from PubChem (Kim
et al., 2019), MoleculeNet (Wu et al., 2018), etc.

Early studies on chemistry LLMs mostly adopt
a moderate-sized encoder-only architecture pre-

trained with MLM (TYPE 1.A, e.g., ChemBERT
(Guo et al., 2022), MatSciBERT (Gupta et al.,
2022), and BatteryBERT (Huang and Cole, 2022)).
These models are usually evaluated on downstream
tasks including reaction role labeling (Guo et al.,
2022) and abstract classification (Gupta et al.,
2022). Recently, researchers have focused more on
large-scale decoder-only LLMs trained with next
token prediction and instruction tuning (TYPE 2.A).
Examples include ChemDFM (Zhao et al., 2024),
ChemLLM (Zhang et al., 2024b), and LlaSMol
(Yu et al., 2024a). Given the desired generalization
capability of such models, they are evaluated on a
diverse set of tasks such as name conversion (Kim
et al., 2019), reaction prediction (Jin et al., 2017),
retrosynthesis (Schneider et al., 2016), text-based
molecule design (Edwards et al., 2022), and crystal
generation (Antunes et al., 2023; Flam-Shepherd
and Aspuru-Guzik, 2023; Gruver et al., 2024).

5.2
Language + Graph

Graphs are appropriate data structures for characterizing molecules (Jin et al., 2023a). Popular datasets
containing molecular graphs include ChEBI-20
(Edwards et al., 2021, 2022), ZINC (Sterling and
Irwin, 2015), and PCDes (Zeng et al., 2022).

In some scenarios, molecular graphs appear simultaneously with text information, thus existing
works have explored how to encode both effectively.
The first type of such models adopts a GNN as the
graph encoder and an LLM as the text encoder. The
two modalities are connected through contrastive
learning (Liu et al., 2023d) (TYPE 3.C). For example, Text2Mol (Edwards et al., 2021) uses GCN
(Kipf and Welling, 2017) and SciBERT to encode
a molecule and its corresponding natural language
description, respectively, for text-to-molecule retrieval. The second type of such models utilizes
an LLM to encode text and graphs simultaneously
(Zeng et al., 2022). Graphs can be either linearized
to SMILES strings (Edwards et al., 2022) (TYPE
2.C) or projected onto virtual tokens with graph encoders (Zhao et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023e) (TYPE
2.D). For instance, 3D-MoLM (Li et al., 2024c)
uses a 3-dimensional molecular encoder to represent molecules as tokens and feeds them together
with instructions into LLaMA-2 for molecule-totext retrieval and molecule captioning.

5.3
Language + Vision

Complementing text and graph modalities, molecular images form the vision modality in chemistry.
Existing works adopt a similar philosophy to BLIP2 (Li et al., 2023b), which represents each image

---

as tokens and feeds them into an LLM (TYPE 2.D).
For example, GIT-Mol (Liu et al., 2024a) projects
all modalities, including graphs and images, into
the latent text space and conducts encoding and
decoding using T5 (Raffel et al., 2020).

5.4
Molecule

Different from subsection 5.2, this subsection introduces models dealing with molecules without associated text information. That being said, comparable approaches inspired by LLMs are utilized to develop molecular language models (Flam-Shepherd
et al., 2022). To be specific, most studies adopt
SMILES or SELFIES (Krenn et al., 2020) strings as
the sequential representation of molecules. Similar
to the trend in the “Language” modality, pioneering molecular LLMs focus on representation learning with bidirectional Transformer encoders (TYPE
1.C, e.g., SMILES-BERT (Wang et al., 2019) and
MoLFormer (Ross et al., 2022)). For instance,
ChemBERTa (Chithrananda et al., 2020) adopts
the architecture and pre-training strategy similar
to those of RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). These
models exhibit extraordinary abilities in molecular
understanding tasks such as molecular property prediction (e.g., toxicity classification (Wu et al., 2018)
and atomization energy regression (Ramakrishnan
et al., 2014)) as well as virtual screening (Riniker
and Landrum, 2013). Later works explore the idea
of representing molecules in an autoregressive fashion (TYPE 2.C, e.g., BARTSmiles (Chilingaryan
et al., 2024) and ChemGPT (Frey et al., 2023)). For
instance, T5Chem (Lu and Zhang, 2022) adopts
the T5 backbone and a sequence-to-sequence pretraining objective. These models are evaluated in
generative tasks that include molecule generation
(Gaulton et al., 2017), reaction prediction, and retrosynthesis. Besides linearizing molecules, there
are studies modifying the Transformer architecture
to admit molecular graphs, such as MAT (Maziarka
et al., 2020) and R-MAT (Maziarka et al., 2024).

5.5
Applications in Scientific Discovery

Previous studies have shown that LLMs facilitate
autonomous chemical research. For example, Bran
et al. (2024) present a chemistry LLM agent, ChemCrow, that can integrate expert-designed tools for
organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design; Zheng et al. (2023a) demonstrate that LLMs
can perform knowledge synthesis from the scientific literature, knowledge inference from data, and
interpretable explanation generation in chemistry;
Boiko et al. (2023) develop an LLM-empowered
intelligence system, Coscientist, that can design,

plan, and perform chemical research. Moreover,
LLMs accomplish complex tasks in chemistry, such
as drug and catalyst design and molecular discovery, purely from instructions (White, 2023). For
instance, Ramos et al. (2023) study catalyst and
molecule design with in-context learning, removing the requirement for traditional training or simulation processes; ChatDrug (Liu et al., 2024b) explores drug editing using LLMs with a prompt module, a domain feedback module, and a conversation
module; Jablonka et al. (2024) find that fine-tuned
LLMs perform comparably to, or even better than,
conventional techniques for many chemistry applications, spanning from the properties of molecules
and materials to the yield of chemical reactions;
DrugAssist (Ye et al., 2023a) serves as an LLMbased interactive model for molecule optimization
through human-machine dialogue; Sprueill et al.
(2023, 2024) use LLMs as agents to search for effective catalysts through Monte Carlo Tree Search
and the feedback from an atomistic neural network
model; Wang et al. (2024b) re-engineer crossover
and mutation operations for molecular discovery
using LLMs trained on extensive chemical datasets.
Meanwhile, benchmarking studies by Mirza et al.
(2024) demonstrate that although LLMs achieve
superhuman proficiency in many chemical tasks,
further research is critical to enhancing their safety
and utility in chemical sciences.

Besides research articles (e.g., titles/abstracts from

and Sequeira, 2003)), pre-training corpora for
biomedical LLMs include electronic health records
(e.g., MIMIC-III (Johnson et al., 2016), MIMICIV (Johnson et al., 2023)), knowledge bases (e.g.,
UMLS (Bodenreider, 2004)), and health-related social media posts (e.g., COVID-19 tweets (Müller
et al., 2023)). Recent studies further collect supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization
datasets from medical exam questions, knowledge
graphs, and doctor-patient dialogues. Examples include ChiMed (Ye et al., 2023b), MedInstruct-52k
(Zhang et al., 2023d), and BiMed1.3M (Acikgoz
et al., 2024), many of which have non-English components (e.g., Chinese and Arabic).

The watershed moment in the evolution biomedical LLMs is still the emergence of billionparameter architectures and instruction tuning. Before that, a wide variety of moderate-sized back-

bones are explored, including both encoder-based
(TYPE 1.A, e.g., BioBERT (Lee et al., 2020), BioELECTRA (Ozyurt, 2020), BioRoBERTa (Lewis
et al., 2020b), BioALBERT (Naseem et al., 2022),
and Clinical-Longformer (Li et al., 2022a)) and
(encoder-)decoder-based ones (TYPE 2.A, e.g., SciFive (Phan et al., 2021), BioBART (Yuan et al.,
2022a), and BioGPT (Luo et al., 2022)). Evaluation tasks for these models range from biomedical NER, RE, sentence similarity estimation, document classification, and QA (i.e., the BLURB
benchmark (Gu et al., 2021)) to natural language
inference (NLI) (Romanov and Shivade, 2018)
and entity linking (Do˘gan et al., 2014). After the
watershed, the trend becomes instruction-tuning
billion-parameter LLMs (TYPE 2.A, e.g., MedPaLM (Singhal et al., 2023a), MedAlpaca (Han
et al., 2023), and BioMistral (Labrak et al., 2024)).
Accordingly, evaluation tasks now include singleround QA (Jin et al., 2021; Pal et al., 2022) and
multi-round dialogue (Wang et al., 2024g). Meanwhile, there are studies proposing a Bi-Encoder
architecture (TYPE 3.A, e.g., Jin et al. (2023c) and
Xu et al. (2024)) that specifically targets biomedical retrieval tasks, the benchmarks of which are
NFCorpus (Boteva et al., 2016), TREC-COVID
(Voorhees et al., 2021), etc.

6.2
Language + Graph

Biomedical ontologies capture rich types of relations between entities. Analogously, citation links
characterize connections between biomedical papers. Intuitively, jointly leveraging text and such
graph information paves the way for multi-hop reasoning in QA. For instance, Yasunaga et al. (2022a)
propose to use an LLM and a GNN to encode text
and ontology signals, respectively, and deeply fuse
them (TYPE 3.C); Yasunaga et al. (2022b) concatenate text segments from two linked papers together
and feed the sequence into an LLM for pre-training,
which is essentially appending a metadata neighbor
(i.e., reference) as context for MLM (TYPE 1.B).
Both approaches demonstrate significant improvement in QA tasks that require complex reasoning.

6.3
Language + Vision

Biomedical text-image pairs typically come from
two sources: (1) medical reports, such as chest
X-rays (e.g., MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019))
and pathology reports (Huang et al., 2023); as well
as (2) figure-caption pairs extracted from biomedical papers (e.g., ROCO (Pelka et al., 2018) and
MedICaT (Subramanian et al., 2020)).

Most biomedical vision-language models exploit

the CLIP architecture (Radford et al., 2021), where
a text encoder and an image encoder are jointly
trained to map the paired text and image closer
via contrastive learning (TYPE 3.D). The choice
of the text encoder evolves from BERT (Zhang
et al., 2022) and GPT-2 (Huang et al., 2023) to
LLaMA (Wu et al., 2023) and LLaMA-2 (Liu et al.,
2023b), while the image encoder evolves from
ResNet (Huang et al., 2021) to ViT (Zhang et al.,
2023c) and Swin Transformer (Thawkar et al.,
2024). MLM, masked image modeling, and texttext/image-image contrastive learning (i.e., by creating augmented views within the language/vision
modality) are sometimes adopted as auxiliary pretraining tasks. Besides CLIP, other general-domain
vision-language architectures, such as LLaVA (Li
et al., 2023a), PaLM-E (Tu et al., 2024), and Gemini (Saab et al., 2024), have been explored. For
instance, LLaVA-Med (TYPE 2.D) encodes images
onto several visual tokens and prepends them to
text tokens as the LLM input. Evaluation tasks
of these models encompass image classification,
segmentation, object detection, vision QA, text-toimage/image-to-text retrieval, and report generation, the benchmarks of which include CheXpert
(Irvin et al., 2019), PadChest (Bustos et al., 2020),
SLAKE (Liu et al., 2021a), etc.

6.4
Protein, DNA, RNA, and Multiomics

The FASTA format (Lipman and Pearson, 1985)
naturally represents proteins as amino acid sequences and DNAs/RNAs as nucleotide sequences,
enabling models to treat them as “languages”.
Representative resources of such sequences include UniRef (Suzek et al., 2015) and SwissProt (Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000) for proteins,
GRCh38 (Harrow et al., 2012) and the 1000
Genomes Project (Consortium, 2015) for DNAs, as
well as RNAcentral (Consortium, 2019) for RNAs.

Encoder-only protein, DNA, and RNA LLMs
(TYPE 1.D), such as ESM-2 (Lin et al., 2023b),
DNABERT (Ji et al., 2021), and RNABERT
(Akiyama and Sakakibara, 2022), adopt BERT-like
architectures and MLM as the pre-training task
(i.e., predicting masked amino acids, nucleotides,
k-mers, or codons); decoder-only models, such
as ProGen (Madani et al., 2023) and DNAGPT
(Zhang et al., 2023a), exploit GPT-like architectures and next token prediction as the pre-training
task. There are also studies jointly considering
text and protein modalities. For instance, ProtST
(Xu et al., 2023b) matches protein sequences with
their text descriptions (i.e., names and functions)
via contrastive learning (TYPE 3.B); BioMedGPT

---

(Luo et al., 2023c) first projects proteins onto tokens and then inputs these tokens together with
text into LLaMA-2 for instruction tuning, bearing
similarity with TYPE 2.D.

Existing multiomics LLMs mainly focus on
single-cell transcriptomics (e.g., scRNA-seq) data,
such as the expression levels of genes within a
single cell (Franzén et al., 2019). Besides BERTbased (e.g., Geneformer (Theodoris et al., 2023))
and GPT-based (e.g., scGPT (Cui et al., 2024)) architectures, Performer (Yang et al., 2022a; Hao
et al., 2024) is widely used due to its linear attention complexity in handling long scRNA-seq data.

6.5
Applications in Scientific Discovery

Similarly to chemistry, LLMs can automate experiments in biological and medical research. For
example, CRISPR-GPT (Huang et al., 2024a) augments an LLM agent with domain knowledge
to enhance the design process of CRISPR-based
gene-editing experiments; TrialMind (Wang et al.,
2024h) utilizes LLMs to extract results and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature for medical discovery. Moreover, LLMs can encode biological sequences to capture structural properties and
guide protein design. For instance, ESM-1b (Rives
et al., 2021) and ESM-2 (Lin et al., 2023b) enable accurate structure prediction of proteins without expensive and time-consuming experiments;
Ferruz and Höcker (2022) fine-tune LLMs on protein families, which can generate highly divergent
but still potentially functional novel sequences; He
et al. (2024a) leverage an LLM for the de novo
generation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with desired
antigen-binding specificity; Hie et al. (2021) develop LLMs to evaluate the evolutionary fitness of
viral variants using sequence data alone.

7
LLMs in Geography, Geology, and
Environmental Science (Table A6)

7.1
Language

Geoscience research papers, climate-related news
articles, Wikipedia pages, corporate sustainability
reports, knowledge bases (e.g., GAKG (Deng et al.,
2021)), and point-of-interest (POI) data (e.g., OpenStreetMap (Haklay and Weber, 2008)) constitute
the pre-training corpora for geoscience LLMs.

Preliminary research on geoscience LLMs focuses on pre-training bidirectional LLMs with the
Transformer encoder backbone (TYPE 1.A, e.g.,
ClimateBERT (Webersinke et al., 2021), SpaBERT
(Li et al., 2022b), and MGeo (Ding et al., 2023)).
For instance, SpaBERT and MGeo perform MLM

on a sequence of geolocations for geographic
entity linking and query-POI matching, respectively. More recently, related studies concentrate
on scaling up decoding-style autoregressive LLMs
in geoscience (TYPE 2.A, e.g., K2 (Deng et al.,
2024), OceanGPT (Bi et al., 2023b), and GeoGalactica (Lin et al., 2024c)). For instance, K2 and
OceanGPT adapt LLaMA to geoscience and ocean
science, respectively, via supervised fine-tuning
with domain-specific instructions curated by human experts and/or augmented by general-domain
LLMs. Evaluations of such models are conducted
on geoscience benchmarks, such as GeoBench
(Deng et al., 2024) and OceanBench (Bi et al.,
2023b), which encompass a broad range of tasks
including QA, classification, knowledge probing,
reasoning, summarization, and generation.

7.2
Language + Graph

Some geoscience applications involve graph signals, such as heterogeneous POI networks and
knowledge graphs. To handle such signals and
text jointly, ERNIE-GeoL (Huang et al., 2022) introduces a Transformer-based aggregation layer
to deeply fuse text and POI information within a
BERT-based architecture; PK-Chat (Deng et al.,
2023) combines an LLM with a pointer generation network on a knowledge graph to build a
knowledge-driven dialogue system.

7.3
Language + Vision

Aerial views, together with location descriptions,
profile urban regions. To address language and
vision modalities jointly, UrbanCLIP (Yan et al.,
2024) considers the CLIP architecture (TYPE 3.D),
which is also widely adopted by biomedical visionlanguage models as mentioned in subsection 6.3, to
perform text-image contrastive learning for urban
indicator prediction.

7.4
Climate Time Series

The intuitions and methodologies used in LLMs
also facilitate the construction of climate foundation models. Based on the ERA5 (Hersbach et al.,
2020) and CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) datasets of
climate time series, previous studies exploit the ViT
and Swin Transformer architectures to pre-train
foundation models for weather forecasting. Representative models include FourCastNet (Pathak
et al., 2022), Pangu-Weather (Bi et al., 2023a), etc.

7.5
Applications in Scientific Discovery

In geography, Wang et al. (2023b) and Zhou et al.
(2024b) highlight the potential of LLMs in urban

---

planning from sustainability, living, economic, disaster, and environmental perspectives. In geology,
besides climate and weather forecasting, foundation models have been applied to simultaneous
earthquake detection and phase picking (Mousavi
et al., 2020). In environmental science, ChatClimate (Vaghefi et al., 2023) enhances GPT-4 by providing access to external, scientifically accurate
knowledge on climate change to build a climate
science conversational AI.

8
Challenges and Future Directions

In this survey, we compile literature that elucidates
the data, architectures, and tasks used for scientific
LLM pre-training, as well as how scientific LLMs
have been applied to downstream applications in
scientific discovery. In particular, we underscore
analogous architectures, tasks, and trends observed
during the evolution of scientific LLMs across different fields and modalities. Beyond reviewing
prior research, we present several challenges to
inspire further exploration of this topic.
Diving into Fine-Grained Themes. Most existing
scientific LLMs target a coarse-grained field (e.g.,
chemistry), while some tasks rely on highly specialized knowledge of a fine-grained theme (e.g.,
Suzuki coupling). When LLMs are pre-trained
on more general corpora, frequently appeared signals may dominate the model parameter space,
and domain-specific tail knowledge may be wiped
out. We believe that automatically curating indepth, theme-focused knowledge graphs (Hope
et al., 2021) to guide the generation process will be
a promising direction to tackle this issue.
Generalizing to Out-of-Distribution Scientific
Data. In the scientific domain, it is common that
the testing distribution shifts from the training distribution (Zhang et al., 2023e): novel scientific
concepts keep emerging in newly published papers;
unseen molecules with different scaffolds and unseen proteins with different numbers of peptide
chains may appear during testing. Handling such
out-of-distribution data remains a challenge for pretrained scientific LLMs. To our knowledge, invariant learning (Arjovsky et al., 2019) can serve as the
theoretical foundation for out-of-distribution analyses, and how to integrate it into LLM pre-training
is worth exploring.
Facilitating Trustworthy Predictions. LLMs can
generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect output, commonly known as hallucination (Ji
et al., 2023), which is particularly dangerous in
high-stakes scientific domains such as chemistry

and biomedicine. To mitigate this issue, retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) provides LLMs with
relevant, up-to-date, and trustworthy information.
However, previous RAG studies in the scientific domain mainly focus on retrieving text (Xiong et al.,
2024) and knowledge (Jin et al., 2024), while scientific data are heterogeneous and multi-modal. We
envision that cross-modal RAG (e.g., guiding text
generation with relevant chemicals and proteins)
will present additional opportunities to further enhance the trustworthiness of scientific LLMs.

Limitations

This survey primarily covers LLMs in mathematics
and natural sciences. We are aware that LLMs can
also significantly impact social sciences by achieving remarkable performance in representative tasks
(Ziems et al., 2024) and serving as agents for social simulation experiments (Horton, 2023), but
we leave the survey of these efforts as future work
due to space limitations. In addition, this paper focuses on LLMs pre-trained on scientific data or augmented with domain-specific knowledge to benefit
scientific discovery. There are studies (Guo et al.,
2023; Wang et al., 2024f; Yue et al., 2024a; Liang
et al., 2024d) proposing new benchmark datasets
of scientific problems but evaluating the performance of general-purpose LLMs only, and we do
not include these works in our survey. Furthermore,
some LLMs may belong to more than one field or
modality category given our classification criteria
in the paper. For instance, BioMedGPT (Luo et al.,
2023c) is pre-trained on biology and chemistry data
jointly; GIT-Mol (Liu et al., 2024a) considers the
language, graph, and vision modalities simultaneously. For the sake of brevity, we introduce each of
them in only one subsection.

Summary Tables of Scientific LLMs

Table A1-Table A6 summarize the modality, number of parameters, model architecture, pre-training
data, pre-training task(s), and evaluation task(s) of scientific LLMs in each field. Within each field, we
categorize models according to their modality; within each modality, we sort models chronologically. To
be specific, if a paper has a preprint (e.g., arXiv or bioRxiv) version, its publication date is according to
the preprint service. Otherwise, its publication date is according to the conference proceeding or journal.

Table A1: Summary of LLMs in general science. “L”: Language; “L+G”: Language + Graph; “∼”: generally
adopting the architecture but with modifications; “MLM”: masked language modeling; “NSP”: next sentence
prediction; “NER”: named entity recognition; “RE”: relation extraction; “QA”: question answering.
